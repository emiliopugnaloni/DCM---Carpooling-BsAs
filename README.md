# DCM-Carpooling-BsAs
Research project about the viability of carpooling in Buenos Aires using Discrete Choice Modelling. It was financed by Universidad Catolica de Argentina

Both parts of the carpoolers were studied: passengers (demand) and drivers (supply). 

Different discrete choice models were applied:
- Multinomial Logit Models
- Mixed Logit Models
- Hybrid Choice Models, with latent class variables

  Results were shown in Endio's and UCA's congresses, and Epio's paper
